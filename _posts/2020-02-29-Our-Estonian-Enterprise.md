A Cultural Enterprise - The Mola Mola GIS team procured a digital elevation model at a 10-meter resolution for the southern region of Estonia, and selected our investigation site at the Town of Viljandi in Viljandi County.  The historic castle site at Viljandi dates to 1224 A.D. and is at the center of the cultural heritage of Estonia.  Mola Mola Consulting’s effort is to ensure that surrounding areas are not prone to landslides that would jeopardize Castle Viljandi.
