Here is a link to a GIS-related paper by Nicole Dash from back in 1997.  Dr. Dash is currently Associate Dean of the College of Health and Public Service at the University of North Texas, where she has taught Sociology of Disasters and Emergency Management and Disaster Science.  This paper, titled "The Use of Geographic Information Systems in Disaster Research", was published as a chapter in the International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters, March 1997, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 135 - 146.

We found it interesting because it lets you look back at earlier concepts and applications of GIS to natural disaster management.  We thought it would be a good exercise to see what was believed back then GIS could accomplish in regard to natural disasters, compared to what uses we know it has today.  Has today's use of GIS met with 1997 expectations?  What aspects of GIS use are easier today than back then?  It seems procuring useful data remains a difficult issue.

One of the arguments posed in regard to natural disaster management called our attention.  That Geographic Information Systems are most successful when implemented by GIS specialists who are thinking professionals capable of generating relatable ideas, and are aware of both the geoprocessing technology and the science of disaster research.

Another is the idea that research and experience should drive the use of GIS technology; that producing a map should not be the sole purpose of GIS applications, that a map is but a product of analysis, and that in GIS, analysis is in fact the true value.    

It reads well; check it out here (you may have to copy and paste this link in your browser):
