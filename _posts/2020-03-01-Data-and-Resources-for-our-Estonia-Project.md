Capitalize on Opportunities - Mola Mola Consultants procures additional data sources for the Estonia project. 

Our GIS products are the result of exhaustive research into the variables necessary to effectively evaluate susceptibility.  

For our landslide susceptibility evaluations, we will follow the Critical Rainfall Threshold Model after Iverson, 2000 (below).  In order to obtain an applicable factor of safety (Fs), the Mola Mola team has embarked in a research operation to locate reliable data sources for the each of the model’s variables.


Fs = (tan φ / tan θ) + [C- ψt * γw * tan (φ) / γr * H * (sin θ) * (cos θ)]

where:

•	Fs is the factor of safety

•	φ is internal angle of friction (deg)

•	θ is hillslope (deg)

•	C is soil cohesion (Pa = kg/m/s2)

•	ψt is pressure head (m) = h * cosθ (Eq. 6, Gabet et al., 2004)

•	γw is unit weight of water (N/m3); N=kg*m/s2

•	γr is unit weight of soil regolith (N/m3)

•	H is soil regolith thickness (m)


Mola Mola will identify potential landslide areas proximal to Viljandi Castle by following specific methodology; the initial steps are described below:

•	Utilize soil maps to identify soil types existing within and surrounding the area of our research site.

•	Locate information for the specific characteristics of the particular soils: internal angle of friction and cohesion coefficients, 
        
•	Review available groundwater maps and soil surveys to ascertain the elevation of watertable and determine pressure head, 

•	Examine DEMs, topographic and slope maps to calculate the thickness and weight of soil regolith, and hillslope in the study area. 


Our methodology is adaptive and evolves with arising needs on each project; the various steps in our process are continuously reviewed by expert GIS analysts and expanded or streamlined as required to expedite accurate results.  Given the starting methodology described above, our plan is to identify and utilize GIS to visualize areas meeting the prerequisite criteria for susceptibility, and, determine their location and extent in reference to Viljandi Castle.
